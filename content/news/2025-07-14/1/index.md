We're proud to reveal the logo for CoMaps — designed and chosen by the **community**.

From maps to code to design, CoMaps is 100% community-powered — and this logo is no different. It’s a symbol of what we’re building together: free, open, and offline map navigation for everyone.

The winning logo was created by @Flummic. The initial round had 21 logos submitted, resulting in 6 finalists, followed by an iteration process where people collaborated to make improvements (https://codeberg.org/comaps/Governance/issues/78).

Thank you to everyone who shaped this milestone. We’re just getting started!
