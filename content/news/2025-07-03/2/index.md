"CoMaps, a recently launched fork of the open source GPS navigation app Organic Maps, is now officially available on major app stores. Users can download CoMaps for iOS via the Apple App Store and for Android on the Google Play Store and F-Droid.

CoMaps shares core functionality with Organic Maps. It allows users to plan and navigate trips entirely offline. It's entirely free to use, with no ads, and it collects no personal data. Additionally, its efficient design ensures minimal battery consumption, making it suitable for travelers seeking private, uninterrupted navigation.

What sets CoMaps apart is a fully transparent governance approach. All decisions about the app's development are made publicly, with users and contributors having a voice in its future direction. This focus on community engagement aims to deliver value for its users rather than prioritize profit."
