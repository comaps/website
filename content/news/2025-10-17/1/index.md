CoMaps is only possible thanks to the global, collective efforts of the thousands of contributors to OpenStreetMap. And of course CoMaps also allows its users to contribute to this gigantic effort, by having an editor that allows adding new places as well as editing existing points of interests, amenities and so on.

But as editing OpenStreetMap, especially on the go, can be quite a daunting task, the CoMaps editing options have been streamlined to offer limited editing options when compared with dedicated OSM editing tools. Instead, for more complex issues, like adjusting finer details of a shop, changing the category of a place, or deleting it, CoMaps allows people to open "notes" that are accessible to all OSM users.

These notes thus contain valuable information, and importantly are mostly designed to be actionable without having someone else do surveying on the ground. And of course, many CoMaps users are also happy to answer question, in case more information is needed.

That sounds all great, doesn't it? Indeed, but of course those notes only really help to improve the OSM data - and thus future releases of CoMaps - if they are actually being integrated into the database. And unfortunately, not all notes will be read or acted on. But luckily, you could help us change that!

As mentioned above: Most of the notes left by CoMaps users require virtually no local knowledge. For example, if a CoMaps user "surveyed" a place via CoMaps and reported via a note that a POI doesn't exist anymore, then it just requires checking if someone has updated the place in OpenStreetMap after the date the note was written. And if that's not the case, you can adjust the map accordingly and close the note! 

If this sounds like something you'd like to give a try: [_NotesReview_](https://ent8r.github.io/NotesReview/?view=map&query=CoMaps&limit=250) allows you to find all the open notes around the world that have been opened by fellow CoMaps users! Give it a look a see if there's maybe even some open notes close by to you, or in regions or places you know. Not all notes can easily be solved, but there will be plenty that make for excellent _good first issues_. And, if you have so far not contributed to OpenStreetMap, those notes can also be a good first step to learn more about how to contribute, and who knows, maybe you will soon find yourself being an active mapper!
