Zion National Park is a huge wasteland, which is what makes it so interesting. The park has peaks thousands of feet high, varying terrain, and a large list of animal species that live there. It's no wonder people flock to Zion National Park every year. It's massive size - 210 square miles, or approximately 350 square kms - makes it a magnet for adventurers every year, but it's also a place where it wouldn't be good to get lost! If you're looking for a map of Zion National Park, consider taking CoMaps along for the fun!

== Driving Directions to Zion National Park
You probably weren't expecting me to mention getting to Zion National Park in this post, but CoMaps makes a great navigation app.

- It works offline, so you don't need to keep your data on while driving. Leaving your data on allows other apps to download notifications and such, which will use up your battery before you even get there! Unplug and drive.
- CoMaps works reliably anywhere in Utah, even if your carrier has dead zones.

All you need to do is download the maps you need before you leave on your adventure, like the map of Zion National Park, and any other maps you'll need to get there.

== A Map of Zion National Park Hiking Trails
Not only does CoMaps have virtually all the Zion National Park trails you'll want to know about, but it has a walking navigation mode too, so you can get turn-by-turn directions to where you want to go. Just point somewhere on the map and as long as there's a trail CoMaps will find a way to get you there.

I do recommend having a printed paper map of Zion National Park, a guidebooklet, and a physical compass with you at all times while you hike at the park. After all, those don't need batteries. On the other hand, here is why you still want CoMaps with you while you're out having fun:

- With CoMaps you always know where you are on the map.
- At a glance you can see where some of the roughest peaks are.
- CoMaps makes it easy to check the distance to other locations on your hike.
- If you do get stuck, you'll know exactly what your coordinates are so you can phone or radio it in.

== Find What You Need Quickly
With CoMaps, you can easily find a place to eat and cool off. Feel like having a burger? Eat at [Oscar's Cafe](https://comaps.at/0jnXsMFbua/Oscar%27s_Cafe). Want a taco and nachos? Try [Sotelo's Mexican Food](https://comaps.at/0jnXsGkxy7/Sotelos_Mexican_Food) (or Oscar's Cafe, they have Mexican food too). If Pizza sounds best, go to [Zion's Pizza and Noodle Company](https://comaps.at/0jnXsMRiiP/Zion_Pizza_%26_Noodle_Co.). Basically, you have the option to search for food offline.

Another nice feature of CoMaps is the ability to search for different amenities. If you need to use the bathroom, or your water bottle needs a little extra water, you can search for "bathroom" or "drinking water" on the map to find one nearby. Then just press the "route to" button and you'll know how to get there, and how far away it is from you. Of course, you shouldn't depend only on CoMaps for water in the wilderness, but it is easy to keep track of where amenities are supposed to be at all times.

== Safety Comes First
While I hope you have a great time exploring Zion National Park, please go prepared. As the National Park Service website [says](https://www.nps.gov/zion/planyourvisit/watersources.htm), "Plan ahead and prepare, your safety is your responsibility." If you plan to go out in the wilderness at all, here are a few items to consider bringing:

- *Emergency Navigation*: A compass and a paper map of the area (plus CoMaps).
- *Water*: At least 1 gallon (approximately 3.7 liters) per person.
- *Clothing*: Loose, cool clothing that will protect you from the sun, a hat, and sunscreen.
- *CoMaps*: Your phone loaded with a map of the Zion National Park trails, amenities, and more, 1 battery backup, and 1 short charging cable. Be sure to keep that battery backup out of the sun!
- *Survival Gear*: A knife, a lighter, a shortwave radio, a small pot in case you need to boil water.

Also, be sure to bring a single piece of chewing gum, a paperclip, and a used roll of duct tape. Why? Because that's what MacGyver would bring.

Have fun out there!
