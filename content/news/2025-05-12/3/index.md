Work on a community fork is progressing rapidly!

The project's core principles are **Transparency, Community Decision-making, Not-for-profit & for Public Interest, Fully Open Source and Privacy-focused**. Read more about the project's essence and direction at our new "home" at [https://codeberg.org/comaps](https://codeberg.org/comaps).

The project has a strong start! And now we are focusing on building the foundation, setting up the technology, and many areas are in-progress. Work is continuing on the first release!

The name for the project - *CoMaps (community, collaborative, common, collective, etc.)* - is provisional. We think it's a good one, but would like more people in the community to take part in choosing the final name together!

**The project name voting** happens [here](https://codeberg.org/comaps/Governance/issues/34) and **will conclude on May 20th.**
Sign into Codeberg to vote or suggest a name. People are already signing up in Codeberg to get involved and contribute on the project (including discussing features and reporting bugs).


CoMaps is a community-driven project, here is **how to get involved:**
- Join the development effort [on Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/comaps/comaps) (there are many things to do, even just fixing and updating the docs is an important task)
- Join organizational and decisions-making activities [in our Governance repo](https://codeberg.org/comaps/Governance)
- Spread the word!
- Get in touch if you'd like to help with texts and graphics for social media promotion
- Help build our website in [our Website repo](https://codeberg.org/comaps/website) (check the preview [comaps.app](https://www.comaps.app))
- Donate at [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/comaps/donate) (all donations and spending are handled transparently by Open Collective)

In the next update we'll announce the final project name!

There was no real progress in negotiations with Organic Maps shareholders.

It appears that Viktor is only open to a guarantee not to sell the project, however besides that he wants to retain full control of Organic Maps.

And Organic Maps future is uncertain still, as the disagreement between shareholders (Viktor and Roman) has not been resolved.
