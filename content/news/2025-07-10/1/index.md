Mobile navigation apps often depend on constant connectivity and user tracking, CoMaps offers a refreshing alternative. This newly launched open-source app delivers fully offline navigation and search, powered by rich OpenStreetMap (OSM) data. CoMaps lets you explore your way - whether you're traveling on vacation, navigating a city or on a distant hike - no internet connection is needed.

### Born Through Change, Driven by a Mission

CoMaps was launched after governance concerns emerged within the Organic Maps project. The creation of a new initiative was to have principles of transparency, open collaboration and community empowerment.

From the outset, CoMaps has been clear about its mission: build a navigation app that is driven by the community, stays free from ads, tracking, and profit interests. The name itself - CoMaps - emphasizes this spirit of collaboration, community, and co-creation.

### Fully Offline

CoMaps distinguishes itself with a fully offline experience, making it ideal for travelers, hikers, cyclists, and anyone planning to navigate areas with unknown network coverage. You can pre-download maps for any region and use full search and routing capabilities without a data connection.

CoMaps is built using OpenStreetMap (OSM) data, a global, community-maintained mapping platform known for its detailed and frequently updated geographic data. Thanks to the active OpenStreetMap contributor base all over the world, CoMaps offers comprehensive map coverage across cities, towns, and even remote areas. While Google Maps may offer the most data in the US, outside of North America, OpenStreetMap is often the best choice. You'll benefit from OSM's rich local data, including walking paths, bike trails, and points of interest that are often missing or outdated in commercial map services.

Importantly, CoMaps collects zero user data. No trackers, no location history, no analytics running in the background. "Your data is yours, and only yours," the developers say - and they mean it.

This commitment to community and privacy are very visible. The project's code is completely open and development activity is done in the open on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/comaps/). Major decisions - like the project name or logo - are made collectively by the community, not behind closed doors.

### Thoughtful Features and a Clean Interface

CoMaps doesn't just stand out philosophically; it also shines in practical use. A few of app features which stand out:
- **Offline Search and Route**, plan and navigate your trip abroad without the need for mobile data, and search waypoints while on a distant hike.
- **No Data Collection**, the app is designed with privacy in mind - does not identify people, does not track, and does not collect any information.
- **Battery-saving design**, efficiently uses the battery, doesn't drain your battery like other navigation apps.
- **Modern map styling**, which is clear, minimal, and optimized for different terrains.
- **Contour lines and elevation profiles**, for outdoor exploration.

People can also switch to the "Outdoors" map style to better visualize hiking trails, terrain, and natural features - ideal for adventure seekers.

### Community at the Core

Perhaps the most distinguishing aspect of CoMaps is how it's built. This is not just a community-supported app; it is a community-run project, from governance to design. The development process is open to all - coders, designers, product people, tech support, testers, translators - and the team actively invites public participation. Recent efforts include a global logo design challenge and open community votes on key branding and feature decisions.

In one community update, the team shared:
"_Ever wondered how a community-driven project like CoMaps comes to life? It's all about collaboration, transparency, and a shared vision for a better future._"

Responses have been overwhelmingly positive. One user wrote:
"_Finally the freedom and privacy-respecting open-source map app I needed… and finally not-for-profit!_"
 
 Another said:
 "_Forked, improved, released. Love it._"

### Why People Are Making the Switch

For many people, switching to CoMaps isn't just about ditching ads and trackers - it's about more flexibility during travel. Community-powered apps like CoMaps give people input into the tools they rely on, built by those who actually use them. Powered by OpenStreetMap (OSM), CoMaps benefits from contributions made by locals who know their areas best - not remote corporations. This means the maps are often more detailed, more accurate, and better reflect real-world conditions, especially in places underserved by commercial platforms.

More and more people are choosing CoMaps because they value independence, transparency, and the local details often found in OpenStreetMap data. When you're abroad, off-grid, or in unfamiliar terrain, you don't want to rely on a data-hungry app that assumes you're always online. You want maps that work offline, reflect on-the-ground realities, and respect your privacy. That's why global travelers - from backpackers in the Andes to vacation travelers to European cities - are switching to CoMaps. It's not just a different map app, it's a different philosophy, rooted in local knowledge and collaboration around the world.

### A Better Way to Navigate - Available Now

Free, no ads, no profit motive, and no compromise on privacy, CoMaps is positioning itself as a truly people-centric navigation tool.

CoMaps is already live and available on:
- Google Play Store
- Apple App Store
- F-Droid (for Android users who prefer open-source app repositories)

### Discover More
CoMaps went from an idea of principles to a full-fledged navigation app with popular demand and a clear identity. It's a striking reminder that communities can build great software together (which don't have to come at the cost of privacy).

Whether you're planning your next trip or simply looking for a Google Maps alternative that gives you detailed information, CoMaps is worth a try.

Because great journeys start with the right map.
