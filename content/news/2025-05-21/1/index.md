**Announcing the Winner of the CoMaps Project Name Vote!**

We're excited to share that the community has spoken, and the name chosen for the community navigation app is... **CoMaps!** üéâ

The name is very popular, it recieved twice as many votes (92 votes) as the second choice option (44 votes), and third choice (37 votes). Thank you to everyone who participated, your enthusiasm and community collaboration are incredible!

**Recap**

¬∑	**Goal**: The aim for a name was easy pronounciation that resonated with the project's essence, and was not already trademarked.

¬∑	**Voting**: Community members voted by adding üëç to their favorite names and suggesting names ([codeberg.org/comaps/Governance/issues/34](https://codeberg.org/comaps/Governance/issues/34)).

**CoMaps** stood out for its simplicity and catchiness, as well as for its perfect alignment with the mission to create a community-driven navigation app that empowers people to explore and navigate the world.

**What's Next?**

The community will select the color scheme of the project. If you are interested in collaborating to develop the color scheme, check it out! [codeberg.org/comaps/Governance/issues/56](https://codeberg.org/comaps/Governance/issues/56)
