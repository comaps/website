"CoMaps, a fork of Organic Maps developed after recent disagreements between the original maintainers and some contributors, has released its first preview build. This initial version is currently available only for Android users.

At this stage, the app is not yet listed on the Google Play Store or F-Droid. Instead, interested users can directly download the APK file from CoMaps' Codeberg source code repository. This option allows early adopters to test the app before its wider distribution.

The CoMaps team has announced plans to expand availability. They aim to make the app accessible through F-Droid soon, and are also working on preparing releases for both the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store."
