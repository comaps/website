You need at least iOS 12 or Android 5 to run the app. Devices with later versions can run CoMaps.  
In Android, CoMaps can work on devices with Google Services installed and without Google support.  
To use CoMaps with Android Auto, please check the requirements [here](@/support/how-to-use-android-auto/index.md).
