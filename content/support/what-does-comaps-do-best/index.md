Ease of Navigation, Privacy, and Community. The app is designed to have a simple and intuitive design that makes it easy to find where you want to go and navigate there easily.  Privacy is a top priority to ensure users are not worried about tech companies tracking their location or recording their data.  CoMaps is developed by a thriving community, opening up for anyone to contribute from providing feedback to coding, creating a product that best addresses what people need.

CoMaps is focused on speed, privacy, battery efficiency and minimization of network utilization. It  uses offline maps that enable navigation in places far from civilization or in cities with complex traffic networks. Also, compare our [privacy policy](@/privacy/index.md) with other map apps.
