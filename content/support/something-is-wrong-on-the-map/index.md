The map data source of CoMaps is [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) (OSM). OSM is a community project to build a free and open map. The project is similar to Wikipedia, anyone can add or edit places and they become available to millions of users all over the world.

This means that you can fix everything that's wrong on the map. Join the community and help to make a better map for everyone!

- You can add new places or edit existing POI and building info (addresses, opening hours, names) [directly in CoMaps](@/support/editing-with-CoMaps/index.md)
- If you want to change a POI position, modify a footway/road, or add buildings, take a look at the [advanced map editing](@/support/advanced-map-editing/index.md) page.
- If you don't have to fix the map yourself, you can also [leave a note](@/support/osm-notes/index.md) for OSM volunteers

The more people contribute, the more detailed maps everyone gets. We believe that it's just a matter of time until CoMaps has the most detailed map of the whole world.
