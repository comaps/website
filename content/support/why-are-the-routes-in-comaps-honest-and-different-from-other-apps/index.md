CoMaps always builds the fastest route according to mapped or estimated speed limits, and checks every alternate route along the way. As of 2025 it does not yet adjust its mapping based on live traffic, which can be a good thing: other apps have been accused of flooding side streets with traffic when main roads get congested, which does not actually improve commutes since those side streets also quickly get congested. CoMaps also does not estimate arrival based on "going with traffic" even if it's over the speed limit: other apps simply estimate arrival based on average actual speeds, which may be illegal in your area.
