If you receive a GPX or KML file by email, messenger app or via a cloud drive, you can import it directly to CoMaps.  

**On iOS**, tap on the GPX/KML file and press the Share button {{ image(src="image21.png" classes="img-inline") }}. Then select CoMaps to open the file. If you tapped on a GPX file you might see the raw code. This is expected, just continue to the share button to open it in CoMaps.

**On Android**, tap on the received GPX/KML file and the _Open with_ dialog will open up. You can then open the file with CoMaps, either as a 'one-off' or set Android to permanently open GPX/ML files with CoMaps.
