If you received a GPX file by email, messenger app or via a cloud drive, you can import it directly to CoMaps.  
On iOS, tap on the GPX file and press the Share button {{ image(src="image21.png" classes="img-inline") }}. Then select CoMaps to open the file.  
On Android, tap on the received GPX file to see the Share menu and then select CoMaps to import the file.
