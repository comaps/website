CoMaps is first and foremost a map app. But it also offers a basic editor that you can use to easily add or fix map data on the fly. It only offers limited functionality and you can only add points of interest from a predefined list or edit properties like opening hours or cousine of existing places. Adding or editing roads or moving places to a new location is not possible. Unlike the ID Editor the built-in editor, however, works offline, once you download the map region. Changes are stored and uploaded to OpenStreetMap.org once you reconnect to the internet.

To edit OpenStreetMap directly from your CoMaps app follow these steps:

1. Create an account at [OpenStreetMap.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org) if you don't already have one  
2. Log into your account in CoMaps (burger icon -> *settings* -> *OpenStreetMap-Profile*)  
3. Now you can either edit existing places or add new ones  
   * Edit existing place by tapping on the icon and selecting *edit place*  
     * Add additional information  
     * Save your changes and exit using the check arrow  
   * Add a place to the map  
     * burger icon -> *Add a place to the OpenStreetMap*  
     * Select the location as accurately as you can and press the check arrow  
     * Select a category

        **Can't find a category that fits? Then create an [OSM Note](https://codeberg.org/comaps/website/issues/203#osm-notes---i-dont-have-time-for-editing).**

     * Add additional information like the name, opening hours, and website  
     * Save your changes and exit using the check arrow

Editing with CoMaps is limited. If you can't edit something with the app you can use the [ID Editor](https://codeberg.org/comaps/website/issues/203#id-editor) instead, or open an [OSM Note](https://codeberg.org/comaps/website/issues/203#osm-notes---i-dont-have-time-for-editing) at OpenStreetMap.org.
