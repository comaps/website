CoMaps is made possible thanks to a wide set of data sources, many which are created by communities, just as our app is!

* [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org), a community-created geographic data base, provides the base data that CoMaps is built on.
* [TIGER](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-geodatabase-file.html), provided by the US Census Bureau, provides additional address data for the United States.
* The basic [US Zip Codes Database](https://simplemaps.com/data/us-zips) provides us with Zip/post codes in the US.
* For UK post codes, CoMaps uses data from the [UK Ordnance Survey](https://osdatahub.os.uk/downloads/open/CodePointOpen) and [Food Hygiene Ratings Scheme](https://data.food.gov.uk/catalog/datasets/38dd8d6a-5ab1-4f50-b753-ab33288e3200), processed using [gb-postcode-data](https://github.com/osm-search/gb-postcode-data).
* [Sonny's Lidar DTM](https://sonny.4lima.de/) provides the elevation data used in Europe.
* [SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission)](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/data/instruments/srtm) provides elevation data outside of Europe.
* [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/), the community-created encyclopedia, provides the detailed texts and information linked to points of interest.
* [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/) is used to link points of interest to the corresponding Wikipedia pages.

Additionally, CoMaps also provides links to other online data sources to provide you with more information or images. This includes:

* [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org), for openly licensed images.
* [Panoramax](https://panoramax.fr/), for openly licensed, community-created street-level imagery. 

Outside of data sources, CoMaps is also made possible by a wide set of open source software and its respective contributors. See the [full list on Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/comaps/comaps/src/branch/main/data/copyright.html).
