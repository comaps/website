CoMaps is a fork/spin-off of Organic Maps, which itself was a fork of Maps.me.

**Background**

In 2011, MapsWithMe (later renamed to [Maps.me](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maps.me)) was founded. In September 2015, the app's code was opened to the public (open-sourced). In 2021, the [Organic Maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_Maps) app was built using Maps.me open-source code as a starting point.

In spring 2025, governance and decision-making issues with Organic Maps were raised by the community contributors in an [Open Letter](https://openletter.earth/open-letter-to-organic-maps-shareholders-a0bf770c), and were not addressed by the company shareholders.

As a result of the issues not being resolved, in April 2025, the community of former Organic Maps contributors created the CoMaps project, based on the Organic Maps open-source code.
