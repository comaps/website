CoMaps is a fork/spin-off of Organic Maps, which once again is a fork/spin-off of Maps.me.

In 2011, MapsWithMe (later renamed to [Maps.me](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maps.me)) was founded, and in September 2015, a decision was made to open-source the app. 

In 2021, the [Organic Maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_Maps) app was built using Maps.me open-source code as a starting point.

In spring 2025, governance issues and community concerns not addressed by company shareholders stalled the development of Organic Maps for months.

In 2025, the CoMaps community & non-profit project was founded by former Organic Maps contributors, based on the Organic Maps source code.
