If you long-tap the map, you can toggle between displaying the UI elements, 
such as the main menu buttons on the bottom of the screen or the zoom and layer buttons.

If you have accidentally entered this mode, you can turn on the UI elements again by doing another long-tap,
i.e. by keeping the map pressed for a bit.
