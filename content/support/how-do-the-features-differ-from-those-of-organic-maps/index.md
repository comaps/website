CoMaps and Organic Maps are very similar as they stated from the same source code.

A major difference between the projects is how they are governed and run - CoMaps is about transparency and community.

Since the split in April 2025, CoMaps has developed a number of features which Organic Maps does not have:

- Improved routing engine and more accurate arrival time estimation
- More dense/detailed altitude contour lines for many regions
- Customizable button on home screen
- Improvements for entering OpenStreetMap data - OSM Notes and POI last checked date
- Routing option to avoid steps
- Better visibility for many map objects, and enhanced map colors for light and dark modes
- Improved first map download experience
- Improvements to search
- Additional Points of Interest on map
- Improve layouts for Right-to-Left languages
- Panoramax pictures links in Points of Interest
- Charging station info for electric vehicles 
- Automatic sync of Favorites, bookmarks, tracks (Android)
- Improved navigation screen (Android)
- And many more
