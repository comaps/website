As the split is recent, the CoMaps app is still very similar to Organic Maps.

The primary differences are how the projects are run - CoMaps is about transparency and community.

So far the improvements in the app include:

•	⁠Custom button on home page
•	⁠Automatic backups for favorites (bookmarks, tracks)
•	⁠More dense/detailed altitude isolines (100m)
•	⁠Removed connection to the “metaserver” and replaced with a static list
•	⁠Improved map colors
•	⁠And many small updates
