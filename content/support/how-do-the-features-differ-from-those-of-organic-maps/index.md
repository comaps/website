CoMaps and Organic Maps are very similar as they started from the same source code.

A major difference between the projects is how they are governed and run - CoMaps is about transparency and community.

Since the split in April 2025, CoMaps has developed a number of features:

- Improved routing engine and more accurate arrival time estimation and support for conditional restrictions

- More dense/detailed altitude contour lines for many regions
- Customizable button on home screen

  - Improved editor and support for OSM Notes
  display of POI "last checked" date
  - option to mark businesses as vacant
  - more objects and POI can be added to OSM (e.g. addresses, vending machines, visitor centers, religion-specific places of worship)
- Better visibility for many map objects, and enhanced map colors for light and dark modes
- Improvements to search
- Additional Points of Interest on the map
- Removed semi-transparent background from Subway layer
- Improved layouts for Right-to-Left languages
- Panoramax picture links in Points of Interest
- On Android:
