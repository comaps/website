CoMaps and Organic Maps are very similar as they started from the same source code.

A major difference between the projects is how they are governed and run - CoMaps is about transparency and community.

Since the split in April 2025, CoMaps has developed a number of features:

- Improved routing engine and more accurate arrival time estimation
- Routing option to avoid steps
- More dense/detailed altitude contour lines for many regions
- Customizable button on home screen
- Automatic backup of Favorites (Bookmarks, Tracks)
- OpenStreetMap functionality: OSM Notes and POI last checked date
- Better visibility for many map objects, and enhanced map colors for light and dark modes
- Improved first map download experience
- Improvements to search
- Additional Points of Interest on the map
- Improved layouts for Right-to-Left languages
- Panoramax picture links in Points of Interest
- Charging station info for electric vehicles (Android)
- Improved navigation screen (Android)
- And many more
