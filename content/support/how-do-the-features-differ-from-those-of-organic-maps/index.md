As the split is recent, the CoMaps app is still very similar to Organic Maps.

The primary differences are how the projects are run - CoMaps is about transparency and community.

So far the improvements in the app include:

- Improved map colors
- Android: automatic backups for favorites (bookmarks, tracks)
- Android: customizable button on home screen
- More dense/detailed altitude contour lines for some regions
- Removed semi-transparent background from Subway layer
- Improved visibility of some map objects
- And many smaller updates
