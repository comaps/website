We are working on a mission document in our [Governance repository](https://codeberg.org/comaps/Governance), to share our vision of what CoMaps as an app should be.

In the meanwhile, we recommend having a look at [OSMand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OsmAnd), which is very feature-rich at the cost of a higher learning-curve.
