Currently, we are focused on creating high-quality offline maps based on open data. Only hotels available on OpenStreetMap are displayed on the map. If you wish, you can [add hotels to the map yourself](/support/editing-with-CoMaps/). 

As for traffic data, the challenge is finding open & privacy-preserving data sources and implementing those. We have already started work to develop our own traffic data server, stay tuned.
