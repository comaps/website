In 2024, F-Droid introduced a new anti-feature called "Tethered Network Services." This anti-feature applies to all apps that rely on web services that cannot be customized, including CoMaps. If you installed the F-Droid app before this update, it may not appear in your F-droid app due to a bug that prevented the anti-feature from being enabled in the settings. However, users who installed the F-Droid app after this update are not affected.

To resolve this issue, please follow these steps:

1. Open the settings
2. Search for "Include Anti-features" and select it.
3. Check the box next to "Tethered Network Services."
