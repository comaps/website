There are a few troubleshooting steps you can take:

* Check in your phone settings that CoMaps has permissions to access your location.
* On some Android devices, disabling the power saver and optimizing your Android phone is often the solution to many GPS issues. You can check [this website](https://dontkillmyapp.com/) for further troubleshooting regarding the power saver/optimization issue.
* On Android, you can toggle between using or not using *Google Fused Location Services*. If CoMaps can't get your location, change this setting, restart CoMaps after a forced shutdown, and see if it now gets your location.
* If you are using [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) with the *Sandboxed Google Play Services* installed and want to use the *Google Fused Location Services*, you will have to give the *Sandboxed Google Play Services* location permission.
