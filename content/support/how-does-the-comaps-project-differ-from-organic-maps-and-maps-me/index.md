Unlike Maps.Me, CoMaps does not collect statistics or user data. It has more up-to-date maps and receives constant improvements in the core functionality, as we are devoted to constantly improving our geo/search/routing algorithms and mobile app performance. In the future, there will be more differences, with a focus on user convenience.

Unlike Organic Maps, CoMaps is "owned" by a not-for-profit co-op, and fully volunteer-driven. We intend to structure the organization such that the app or its users can't be sold for profit or to a non-likeminded organization. We also intend to involve users and volunteers more fully in decisionmaking and governance.
