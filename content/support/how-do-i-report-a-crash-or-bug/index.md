You can [report bugs and crashes via our Codeberg issues](https://codeberg.org/comaps/comaps/issues), preferably in English, but if necessary in other languages too. 
Please check first if similar bugs have already been reported. 

If you want to report a bug or crash, you should ideally also attach a log file, as that will help us a lot to understand what is going wrong.
Read ["How do I enable logs?" to see how to enable and send those reports](/support/how-do-i-enable-logs/).


If you're not entirely sure if what you observe is a bug, you can [join one of our many community channels and discuss the issue there](https://www.comaps.app/community/). 

Please also keep in mind that the presence or absence of a certain incorrect object on the map may not be a bug in the application, but rather an inaccuracy in the underlying OpenStreetMap data that CoMaps uses. 
You can [correct such issues yourself on OSM.org](https://www.openstreetmap.org). The changes you made will appear in one of the following CoMaps data updates.

On iOS, you can also report a crash to the developers by following these instructions:  [https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/deve2819c518](https://help.apple.com/xcode/mac/current/#/deve2819c518)
